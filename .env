# Copy this file to .env or .env.local and set your OpenRouter API key(s)
# NEVER commit your real API key to source control.

# For client-side Vite builds (exposed in the bundle):
# Use the VITE_ prefix so the key is available as import.meta.env.VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
# Example (replace with your real key locally):
# VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-<your_key_here>

# For server-side usage (do not expose to the browser), set the server var instead:
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-<your_key_here>

# Recommended: add the appropriate key to a local .env file and restart the dev server.
# Copy this file to .env and set your OpenRouter API key
# Do NOT commit your real API key to source control.
